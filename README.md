# sma_risk-return
This Python project analyzes stock price data using Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover strategies. It backtests these strategies against current market returns and calculates the Sharpe Ratio of the resulting returns.

## Features
- Calculate SMA and EMA for selected stocks
- Analyze crossover points for trading signals
- Backtest strategies against historical market data
- Calculate and report the Sharpe Ratio for performance evaluation
## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas

## Parameters
- ticker: The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL).
- sma_window: The window size for the Simple Moving Average.
- ema_window: The window size for the Exponential Moving Average.
- start_date: The start date for historical data (YYYY-MM-DD).
- end_date: The end date for historical data (YYYY-MM-DD).
## Backtesting 
The backtesting functionality allows you to evaluate the performance of your crossover strategy. The script will simulate trades based on the crossover signals generated by the SMA and EMA.
## Calculating Sharpe Ratio 
The Sharpe Ratio is calculated to assess the risk-adjusted return of the strategy. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.

The formula used for the Sharpe Ratio is:
Sharpe Ratio = Average Return − Risk-Free Rate​ / Standard Deviation of Returns
